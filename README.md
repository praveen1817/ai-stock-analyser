# AI Stock Analyzer and Market News Intelligence

An end-to-end AI-powered stock analysis system that allows users to input a stock symbol and a natural-language question, then returns structured company data, computed analytics, and AI-generated reasoning through a clean and responsive UI.

The project combines real-time financial data, local caching, vector search, and large language model reasoning to provide fast, explainable, and context-aware stock insights.

## Problem Statement

Retail investors and learners often face the following challenges:

- Financial data is fragmented across multiple platforms
- Raw stock analytics are difficult to interpret
- Market news lacks contextual relevance
- Repeated data fetching increases latency and cost
- Existing tools do not support natural-language interaction

The problem is to design a system that:
- Accepts stock-related questions in plain English
- Combines structured analytics with relevant news
- Reduces redundant API calls
- Produces explainable AI-driven reasoning
- Presents results in a user-friendly interface

## Solution Overview

This project addresses the problem using a cache-first backend architecture combined with AI reasoning.

Key ideas:
- Stock data is cached locally to avoid repeated external requests
- Yahoo Finance data is fetched using browser-like requests to prevent blocking
- Market news is embedded and stored in a vector database
- Semantic search retrieves only the most relevant news
- An LLM generates reasoning based on analytics and contextual information

The result is a fast, scalable, and explainable stock analysis pipeline.
